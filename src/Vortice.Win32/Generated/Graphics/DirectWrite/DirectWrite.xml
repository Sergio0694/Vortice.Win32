  <member name="DWRITE_FONT_METRICS::designUnitsPerEm">
    <summary>The number of font design units per em unit. Font files use their own coordinate system of font design units. A font design unit is the smallest measurable unit in the em square, an imaginary square that is used to size and align glyphs. The concept of em square is used as a reference scale factor when defining font size and device transformation semantics. The size of one em square is also commonly used to compute the paragraph identation value.</summary>

  <member name="DWRITE_FONT_METRICS::ascent">
    <summary>The ascent value of the font face in font design units. Ascent is the distance from the top of font character alignment box to the English baseline.</summary>

  <member name="DWRITE_FONT_METRICS::lineGap">
    <summary>The line gap in font design units. Recommended additional white space to add between lines to improve legibility. The recommended line spacing (baseline-to-baseline distance) is  the sum of <b>ascent</b>, <b>descent</b>, and <b>lineGap</b>. The line gap is usually positive or zero but can be negative, in which case the recommended line spacing is less than the height of the character alignment box.</summary>
